# React Issues Autocomplete
**this project is a search engine with autocompletion for exclusively react issues**

### Navigation ShortCuts
* The Tab shortcut it's for navigation through the results.
* Up-Down Key arrow shortcut it's for navigation through the autocomplete options.
* The Enter Key it's for search results base on the input content also you can select an autocomplete option with Enter Key too.

### Tecnologies I used
* React ( Of course :) )
* Redux (For a simple project like this i could use context API, but for demonstrations purposes i prefer to user redux)
